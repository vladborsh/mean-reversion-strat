# Drawdown Prevention Roadmap

**Status**: Feature Backlog  
**Priority**: High  
**Context**: Based on EURCHF backtest showing 4 consecutive stop losses (-7.45% drawdown) in 2-week period

## Problem Analysis

The recent EURCHF backtest revealed a critical weakness: during trending market conditions, the mean reversion strategy suffered consecutive losses with no mechanism to adapt or protect capital. All 4 trades hit stop losses, indicating the strategy continued trading in unfavorable conditions.

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Trend Detection & Filtering

**Goal**: Prevent trading against strong trends

- **Multi-timeframe trend analysis**: Check 1H and 4H trends before taking 5m signals
- **Trend strength consensus**: Require multiple ADX periods (14, 21, 28) to agree on weak trend  
- **Moving average slope filter**: Avoid trades when price is far from key MAs
- **Directional bias filter**: Only take mean reversion trades when higher timeframe is ranging

**Implementation**: 
- Extend `MarketRegimeFilter` class
- Add multi-timeframe data feeds to strategy
- Create trend consensus scoring system

### 2. Advanced Regime Detection

**Goal**: Better identify when market conditions are unsuitable for mean reversion

- **Dynamic regime scoring**: Enhance existing regime_min_score with adaptive thresholds
- **Volatility spike detection**: Skip trading during volatility breakouts (>95th percentile)
- **Market session awareness**: Strengthen trading hours filter with session-specific rules
- **Economic calendar integration**: Avoid trades around high-impact news

**Implementation**:
- Enhance existing `src/market_regime.py`
- Add volatility percentile tracking
- Create news calendar API integration

### 3. Portfolio-Level Risk Management

**Goal**: Protect account from consecutive losses

- **Daily loss limits**: Stop trading after losing X% in a single day
- **Consecutive loss protection**: Reduce position size after N consecutive losses  
- **Drawdown-based scaling**: Dynamically reduce position size based on account drawdown
- **Maximum concurrent trades**: Limit number of simultaneous positions per symbol

**Implementation**:
- Create new `DrawdownProtection` module
- Add portfolio state tracking to strategy
- Implement circuit breaker mechanisms

### 4. Smart Entry & Exit Enhancements

**Goal**: Improve signal quality and timing

- **Entry confirmation delays**: Wait for additional bars of confirmation before entry
- **Volume validation**: Require above-average volume for mean reversion signals
- **Price action filters**: Add candlestick pattern recognition for reversal confirmation
- **Dynamic stop losses**: Use volatility-adjusted stops instead of fixed ATR multiples

**Implementation**:
- Enhance `src/strategy.py` signal detection logic
- Add volume analysis to indicators
- Create pattern recognition module

### 5. Adaptive Position Sizing

**Goal**: Reduce exposure during unfavorable conditions

- **Volatility-based sizing**: Reduce position size during high volatility periods
- **Confidence scoring**: Scale position size based on signal strength and market conditions
- **Kelly criterion integration**: Use optimal position sizing based on win rate and R:R
- **Recent performance weighting**: Reduce sizing after recent losses

**Implementation**:
- Enhance `src/risk_management.py`
- Add confidence scoring algorithm
- Implement Kelly criterion calculations

### 6. Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (High Priority)**:
1. Daily loss limits and consecutive loss protection
2. Enhanced volatility spike detection
3. Multi-timeframe trend filtering

**Phase 2 (Medium Priority)**:
1. Dynamic position sizing based on recent performance
2. Entry confirmation delays
3. Volume validation for signals

**Phase 3 (Future Enhancement)**:
1. Economic calendar integration
2. Advanced pattern recognition
3. Kelly criterion optimization

## Expected Impact

**Risk Reduction**: 60-80% reduction in consecutive loss scenarios  
**Drawdown Protection**: Maximum daily loss capped at configurable threshold  
**Performance**: Slightly lower total trades but significantly improved risk-adjusted returns  
**Robustness**: Strategy adapts to changing market conditions automatically

## Testing Strategy

1. **Historical backtesting**: Test against known volatile periods (2020 COVID, 2008 crisis)
2. **Out-of-sample validation**: Test on recent 2024-2025 data not used in optimization
3. **Monte Carlo simulation**: Test robustness across various market scenarios
4. **Forward testing**: Paper trading implementation before live deployment

## Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations
- Add feature flags for optional components
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Performance impact analysis for each enhancement
