## Improvement Plan (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: High Priority Improvements (Week 1)

#### 1. Enhanced Risk Management
**Objective:** Reduce drawdowns for high-volatility assets
**Implementation:**
- Scale risk down during high volatility periods (>2% daily moves)
- Implement correlation-based position sizing
- Add maximum daily/weekly risk limits

**Expected Impact:** Reduce drawdowns by 5-10%

#### 2. Entry Signal Refinement
**Objective:** Improve entry timing and signal reliability
**Implementation:**
- Add RSI confirmation (oversold <30 for longs, overbought >70 for shorts)
- Require volume confirmation (>120% of 20-period average)
- Implement trend alignment check (avoid counter-trend in strong moves)

**Expected Impact:** Increase win rate from 34% to 45%+

### Phase 2: Medium Priority Improvements (Week 2)

#### 3. Time-Based Trading Filters
**Objective:** Trade only during optimal market sessions
**Implementation:**
- Avoid low-liquidity hours (21:00-02:00 UTC)
- Focus on London (08:00-16:00) and NY (13:00-21:00) sessions
- Implement overlap session priority (13:00-16:00 UTC)

**Expected Impact:** Reduce false signals, improve trade quality

#### 4. Configuration Optimization
**Objective:** Fine-tune technical indicator parameters
**Implementation:**
- Test longer BB periods (30 vs 20) for more reliable signals
- Adjust standard deviation multipliers (2.2 for BB, 1.8 for VWAP)
- Experiment with different ATR multipliers for stop losses (1.5x vs 1.2x)

**Expected Impact:** Marginal improvements in entry/exit timing

### Phase 3: Low Priority Improvements (Week 3)

#### 5. Enhanced Exit Strategy
**Objective:** Optimize profit capture and loss limitation
**Implementation:**
- Implement trailing stops after 1R profit achievement
- Add partial profit-taking at 0.5R, 1.0R, 1.5R levels
- Dynamic stop loss adjustment based on volatility changes

**Expected Impact:** Increase average trade profitability by 10-15%

## Success Metrics & Targets

### Target Performance (Post-Improvements)
- **Win Rate:** >45% (current: 34.1%)
- **Sharpe Ratio:** >0.5 (current: 0.14)
- **Maximum Drawdown:** <15% (current: 25.7%)
- **Total Trades:** Maintain 100+ for statistical significance
- **Risk-Adjusted Return:** >20% annually

### Implementation Timeline
